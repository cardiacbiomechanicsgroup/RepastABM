"output": file containing the model output files in the following formats
		"modelTag_dateStamp_Parameters.csv": the input parameteres used in the simulation
		"modelTag_dateStamp_WoundStat.csv": the average wound area collagen and cell statistics at each day in the simulation
		"modelTag_dateStamp_WoundColFibAngDist.csv": the average wound area collagen histograms at each day in the simulation

"postProcessing": Contains the MATLAB post-processing scripts
		"averageModels.m": This function averages multiple WoundABM models. Before averaging, the function will check the model parameters to ensure that they are compatible. Note that all models must contain the same statistics, time points, and parameters.
		"FomovskyData.mat": This data set contains the experimental collagen density data generated by Greg Fomovsky.
		"formatHistPlot.m": This function applies the figure formatting for the ABM collagen histograms.
		"formatStatPlot.m": This function applies the figure formatting for the ABM cell and collagen time course statistics.
		"JPhysiolData.mat": This data set contains the collagen and cell orientation data from the MATLAB ABM (J Phiol 2012). 
		"plotMatlabABMHist.m": This function plots the collagen histograms at each week from the MATLAB ABM (J Pysiol 2012) and Greg Fomovsky's experimental data onto the specified figure.
		"plotMatlabABMStats.m": This function plots the collagen and cell time course data from the MATLAB ABM (J Pysiol 2012) and Greg Fomovsky's experimental data onto the specified figure.
		"plotRepastABMHist.m": This function plots the collagen histograms at each week in the selected WoundABM model runs in the specified figure.
		"plotRepastABMStats.m": This function plots the collagen and cell time course data from selected WoundABM model runs in the specified figure.
		"readModelData.m": This function reads the statistics, histogram, and parameter output files of one or more WoundABM model runs.
		"validation.m": This script plots the figures validating the Repast WoundABM against the original MATLAB ABM published J Physiol 2012) and experimental data generated by Greg Fomovsky.

NOTES:
	Due to schochasticity of the model, repeat simulations will yield slight variations in results. We recommend that you perform at least two iterations of each model and average the results during post processing.

	Git versioning is only supported for model files.
